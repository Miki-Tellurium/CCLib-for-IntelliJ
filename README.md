This library requires EmmyLua plugin for IntelliJ IDEA to work properly, 
thank to it's developers for making my life easier with Lua compatibility.

So I just made this to making programming ComputerCraft in IntelliJ easier,
all methods and fields descriptions are taken from the CC:Tweaked wiki. 
This library is updated to the Minecraft 1.19 version of CC:Tweaked,
future versions may change thing so this library could become obsolete,
if you notice something missing you can open a pull request on GitHub, 
I'll see what I can do to update.
